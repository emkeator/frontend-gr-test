This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

To run:

1. Clone & download.
2. cd into this directory (frontend-gr-test).
3. Run npm install.
4. **IMPORTANT!** In terminal, run node index.js (I added the server file that I was given in the project to my code, and changed the port number so that I could run it as a proxy in dev mode). 
5. In another terminal, run npm start --> the site should open on localhost:3000.
